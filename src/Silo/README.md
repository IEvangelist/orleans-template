# Silo

The purpose of this project is to serve as the client app that consumes both the **Abstractions.csproj** and **Grains.csproj** projects. This can be any valid .NET app, such as a web app, desktop app, mobile app, or worker service to name a few. For inspiration see [GitHub: Microsoft Orleans, Samples](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/tree/main/samples).
